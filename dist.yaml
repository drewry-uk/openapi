    <h2>General Information</h2>

    <p>
        You can find general information here:
        <a href="https://developers.freighttrust.com">

        </a>
    </p>


    <h2>Maintenance Window</h2>

    <p>
        No maintenance scheduled.
    </p>


    <h2>URLs</h2>


    API Base URL is <b>https://api.commodityprotocol.com</b>.


    Full URL example: https://api.freighttrust.com/v1.0/contracts/


    <h2>Versioning</h2>

    <p>
        The API is versioned using a version tag in the URL (e.g. /v1.0/). Breaking changes
        are deployed with an incremented API version. Older versions may be marked
        deprecated and be shutdown.
    </p>


    <h2>HTTP Statuses</h2>

     Freight Trust & Clearing uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or
    failure of an API request.


    In general, if the status returned is in the 200 range, it indicates that
    the request

    was fulfilled successfully and that no error was encountered.


    Return codes in the 400 range typically indicate that there was an issue
    with the

    request that was sent. Among other things, this could mean that you did not
    authenticate

    correctly, that you are requesting an action that you do not have
    authorization for,

    that the object you are requesting does not exist, or that your request is
    malformed.


    If you receive a status in the 500 range, this generally indicates a
    server-side problem.

    This means that we are having an issue on our end and cannot fulfill your
    request

    currently.


    Here is a list of supported codes:


    <ul>
        <li>200: Successful Operation</li>
        <li>201: Entity Created</li>
        <li>400: Bad Request Exception / Limit Exceeded Exception</li>
        <li>401: Unauthorized</li>
        <li>403: Forbidden</li>
        <li>422: Validation Error</li>
        <li>429: Too Many Requests Exception</li>
        <li>500: Internal Server Error</li>
        <li>503: Maintenance Mode</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Responses and Data Format</h2>


    When a request is successful, a response body will be sent back in the form
    of a JSON

    object or an array of JSON objects, under the `data` key. Our API only
    supports

    JSON format.


    In the event of a problem, the body of the response will usually contain
    additional

    information about the problem that was encountered, under the `errors` key.


    <h2>Authentication</h2>


    In order to interact with the DrewryAPI, your application must authenticate.


    The DrewryAPI handles this through OAuth, an open standard for

    authorization, with a two-legged Oauth 2 approach (using client
    credentials).


    An access token is needed to authenticate your application for every
    endpoint.


    <h3>How to get an Access Token with OAuth 2?</h3>


    Use the <b>https://api.freighttrust.com/oauth/token/</b> endpoint with your

    credentials to receive a token. The necessary <b>client_id</b> and

    <b>client_secret</b> credentials are provided by Drewry. Please contact us
    at

    info@commodityprotocol.com to request them.


    Because of this, it is <b>absolutely</b> essential that you keep your
    <b>client_id</b>

    and <b>client_secret</b> credentials secure.


    A token is valid for 30 minutes. After that, you can either refresh it or
    create a new

    one.


    <h3>How to Authenticate with your Access Token?</h3>


    In order to make an authenticated request, include a bearer-type
    Authorization header

    containing your OAuth token. <b>All requests must be made over HTTPS.</b>


    For example: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN`


    <h2>Usage Plans</h2>

    <p>
        There are measurements in place to protect the API from abuse. This includes a
        request quota and throttling using the token-bucket pattern, which can be configured
        to the needs of the external service. Every request is counted against your usage
        plan. The default usage plan is as follows.
    </p>


    <ul>
        <li>Throttling (requests per second): 50 req/sec</li>
        <li>Burst (bucket size): 200</li>
        <li>Quota (requests per day): 1000 req/day</li>
    </ul>

      summary: Create An Access Token
      description: >-
        Get a new access_token. Access tokens are the thing that applications
        use to make

        API requests. Access tokens must be kept confidential in storage.


        ### Getting an Access Token


        * Method: POST

        * Body
            * `grant_type` (required) = "client_credentials".
            * `scope` (optional)
        * Headers
            * `Authorization`: The "Basic" HTTP authentication scheme is defined in RFC 7617,
            which transmits credentials as `client_id:client_secret` pairs, encoded using
            base64  .

        A successful response will contain these keys: `access_token`,
        `token_type`,

        `expires_in` (duration of time in seconds the access token is granted
        for) and

        `refresh_token`.


        ### Refreshing an Expired Access Token


        With the `refresh_token`, as the access token will expire, youâ€™ll be
        able to get a

        new one having to specify the scope variable.


        * Method: POST

        * Body
            * `grant_type` (required) = "refresh_token".
        * Headers
            * `Authorization`: The "Basic" HTTP authentication scheme is defined in RFC 7617,
            which transmits credentials as client_id/client_secret pairs, encoded using
            base64 (`client_id:client_secret`).

        If you do not get back a new refresh token, then it means your existing
        refresh

        token will continue to work when the new access token expires.

        ### Data Revision Policy


        Drewry will on occasion publish corrections to price assessments after
        the

        publication date. These errors may arise from clerical mistakes or
        miscalculation

        errors amongst other reasons. Any changes or revisions will take place

        within two working days following the closing of the submission window.
        Drewry

        will send a notification of any changes to its previous assessments via
        email to all

        users with an explanation as to why a correction was implemented.
