  description: "\n<h2>General Information</h2>\n<p>\n    You can find general information
    here:\n    <a href=\"https://developers.freighttrust.com\">\n        https://developers.freighttrust.com/\n
    \   </a>\n</p>\n\n<h2>Maintenance Window</h2>\n<p>\n    No maintenance scheduled.\n</p>\n\n<h2>URLs</h2>\n\nAPI
    Base URL is <b>https://api.commodityprotocol.com</b>.\n\nFull URL example: https://api.freighttrust.com/v1.0/contracts/\n\n<h2>Versioning</h2>\n<p>\n
    \   The API is versioned using a version tag in the URL (e.g. /v1.0/). Breaking
    changes\n    are deployed with an incremented API version. Older versions may
    be marked\n    deprecated and be shutdown.\n</p>\n\n<h2>HTTP Statuses</h2>\n\n
    Freight Trust & Clearing uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the
    success or\nfailure of an API request.\n\nIn general, if the status returned is
    in the 200 range, it indicates that the request\nwas fulfilled successfully and
    that no error was encountered.\n\nReturn codes in the 400 range typically indicate
    that there was an issue with the\nrequest that was sent. Among other things, this
    could mean that you did not authenticate\ncorrectly, that you are requesting an
    action that you do not have authorization for,\nthat the object you are requesting
    does not exist, or that your request is malformed.\n\nIf you receive a status
    in the 500 range, this generally indicates a server-side problem.\nThis means
    that we are having an issue on our end and cannot fulfill your request\ncurrently.\n\nHere
    is a list of supported codes:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>200: Successful Operation</li>\n
    \   <li>201: Entity Created</li>\n    <li>400: Bad Request Exception / Limit Exceeded
    Exception</li>\n    <li>401: Unauthorized</li>\n    <li>403: Forbidden</li>\n
    \   <li>422: Validation Error</li>\n    <li>429: Too Many Requests Exception</li>\n
    \   <li>500: Internal Server Error</li>\n    <li>503: Maintenance Mode</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Responses
    and Data Format</h2>\n\nWhen a request is successful, a response body will be
    sent back in the form of a JSON\nobject or an array of JSON objects, under the
    `data` key. Our API only supports\nJSON format.\n\nIn the event of a problem,
    the body of the response will usually contain additional\ninformation about the
    problem that was encountered, under the `errors` key.\n\n<h2>Authentication</h2>\n\nIn
    order to interact with the DrewryAPI, your application must authenticate.\n\nThe
    DrewryAPI handles this through OAuth, an open standard for\nauthorization, with
    a two-legged Oauth 2 approach (using client credentials).\n\nAn access token is
    needed to authenticate your application for every endpoint.\n\n<h3>How to get
    an Access Token with OAuth 2?</h3>\n\nUse the <b>https://api.freighttrust.com/oauth/token/</b>
    endpoint with your\ncredentials to receive a token. The necessary <b>client_id</b>
    and\n<b>client_secret</b> credentials are provided by Drewry. Please contact us
    at\ninfo@commodityprotocol.com to request them.\n\nBecause of this, it is <b>absolutely</b>
    essential that you keep your <b>client_id</b>\nand <b>client_secret</b> credentials
    secure.\n\nA token is valid for 30 minutes. After that, you can either refresh
    it or create a new\none.\n\n<h3>How to Authenticate with your Access Token?</h3>\n\nIn
    order to make an authenticated request, include a bearer-type Authorization header\ncontaining
    your OAuth token. <b>All requests must be made over HTTPS.</b>\n\nFor example:
    `Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN`\n\n<h2>Usage Plans</h2>\n<p>\n    There are
    measurements in place to protect the API from abuse. This includes a\n    request
    quota and throttling using the token-bucket pattern, which can be configured\n
    \   to the needs of the external service. Every request is counted against your
    usage\n    plan. The default usage plan is as follows.\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Throttling
    (requests per second): 50 req/sec</li>\n    <li>Burst (bucket size): 200</li>\n
    \   <li>Quota (requests per day): 1000 req/day</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Code Samples:</h2>\n\n<a

      summary: Create An Access Token
      description: |-
        Get a new access_token. Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make
        API requests. Access tokens must be kept confidential in storage.

        ### Getting an Access Token

        * Method: POST
        * Body
            * `grant_type` (required) = "client_credentials".
            * `scope` (optional)
        * Headers
            * `Authorization`: The "Basic" HTTP authentication scheme is defined in RFC 7617,
            which transmits credentials as `client_id:client_secret` pairs, encoded using
            base64  .

        A successful response will contain these keys: `access_token`, `token_type`,
        `expires_in` (duration of time in seconds the access token is granted for) and
        `refresh_token`.

        ### Refreshing an Expired Access Token

        With the `refresh_token`, as the access token will expire, youâ€™ll be able to get a
        new one having to specify the scope variable.

        * Method: POST
        * Body
            * `grant_type` (required) = "refresh_token".
        * Headers
            * `Authorization`: The "Basic" HTTP authentication scheme is defined in RFC 7617,
            which transmits credentials as client_id/client_secret pairs, encoded using
            base64 (`client_id:client_secret`).

        If you do not get back a new refresh token, then it means your existing refresh
        token will continue to work when the new access token expires.
