  summary: Read Latest Price Release
  description: >-
    For a specific contract, this endpoint returns the latest Price Releases if,

    according to your current subscription, you can access it.

     Drewry releases (publishes) prices several times per week, which is called
    Price Release. Please read our Methodology and Specifications Guide for more
    details.


    ### Data Revision Policy


    Drewry will on occasion publish corrections to price assessments after the

    publication date. These errors may arise from clerical mistakes or
    miscalculation

    errors amongst other reasons. Any changes or revisions will take place

    within two working days following the closing of the submission window.
    Drewry

    will send a notification of any changes to its previous assessments via
    email to all

    users with an explanation as to why a correction was implemented.
